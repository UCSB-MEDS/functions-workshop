Let's say I want to look at ocean temperature data from three coastal sites within the Santa Barbara Coastal (SBC) LTER: Alegria Reef, Mohawk Reef, Carpenteria Reef. Data are collected by moored instrumentation (CTD & ADCP) at each site. Raw data are available for download on the EDI Data Portal:

  1. Alegria Reef: <https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-sbc.2008.14>
  2. Mohawk Reef: <https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/cbe43646b801bf6ee5231c301ea23f51>
  3. Carpenteria Reef: <https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-sbc.2004.26>
